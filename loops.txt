Implementation of `While` Loop in Shell Script.

vim looping.sh
chmod +x looping.sh  (./looping.sh)

====================================
#/bin/bash

a=0

# lt is less than operator

#Iterate the loop until a less than 10

while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
# Print the values
echo $a
# increment the value
a=`expr $a + 1`
done


=============================

#/bin/bash

a=0

# -gt is greater than operator
#Iterate the loop until a is greater than 10

until [ $a -gt 10 ]
do

# Print the values
echo $a

# increment the value
a=`expr $a + 1`
done

==================
Implementation of `for` Loop with `break` statement in Shell Script.

#/bin/bash

#Start of for loop

for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do

# if a is equal to 5 break the loop
if [ $a == 5 ]
then
break
fi

# Print the value
echo “Iteration no $a”
done

==================

Implementation of `for` Loop with `continue` statement in Shell Script.

#/bin/bash

for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do

# if a = 5 then continue the loop and
# don’t move to line 8

if [ $a == 5 ]
then
continue
fi
echo “Iteration no $a”
done


====================
Implementing `until` Loop in Shell Script

#/bin/bash

a=0

# -gt is greater than operator
#Iterate the loop until a is greater than 10

until [ $a -gt 10 ]
do


=======================
Creating an Infinite Loop with “while true” in Shell Script

#/bin/bash

while true
do

# Command to be executed
# sleep 1 indicates it sleeps for 1 sec
echo “Hi, I am infinity loop”
sleep 1
done
